=======

Config5 is a configuration management utility for UNIX systems. It is particularly well suited to manage large numbers of systems in an enterprise where the configuration varies in the various organizational units. Configuration data can be verified before deployment which makes deployment more resilient to human errors. Config5 is highly customizable and extendable to support a broad variation of UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems.
