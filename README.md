Config5
=======

*Config5* is a configuration management utility for UNIX systems. It is particularly well suited to manage large numbers of systems in an enterprise where the configuration varies in the various organizational units. Configuration data can be verified before deployment which makes deployment more resilient to human errors. *Config5* is highly customizable and extendable to support a broad variation of UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems. 

For more information read the [Systems Administrator's Guide](https://github.com/isginf/config5/blob/master/docs/pdf/guide.pdf?raw=true).

Motivation
==========

[isginf](http://www.isg.inf.ethz.ch) is managing UNIX systems since the early nineties. During that time we have always used custom configuration management utilities to deploy servers and workstations. *Config5* is the fifth utility that we developed, hence its name. We believe that *Config5* may be useful for others too and therefore release it as open source project and make it publicly available.
